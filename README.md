# A Simple Job Application Tracker

This is a simple desktop application to help you track your applications and create personalised CVs and cover letters. All of your information is stored locally on your PC.

## Motivation
> When applying for my summer 2022 internship, I used an Excel sheet to track my applications. This was perfect for tracking details such as application links, status and job description. However, there were features that I wanted in addition a spreadsheet. 
> 1. A way to generate customised CVs and cover letters for each application. By catering to the specific requirement of the company, I believed that my application would be more likely to succeed.
> 2. A place to store information about my application. This includes, screenshots of job descriptions, current action items and progress. This is especially important when dealing with a large volume of applications. In one of my interviews, I could not find the job description on the day before the interview as it was taken down. This severely hurt my chances in this interview.
